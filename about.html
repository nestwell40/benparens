              <strong>I'm Ben</strong> — a builder focused on creating things that help people feel better, with a background in athletics and a reverence for what's possible when you simply feel good.
            </p>

            <p>
              I grew up in a family where good inputs meant good outputs. We weren't big on screens—most of our time was spent outside because that's what made us feel best.
            </p>

            <p>
              That foundation led me to sports and training, then college athletics, then marathons. Somewhere along the way, I developed a reverence for what's possible when you simply <strong>feel good</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's why I'm building <strong>Nestwell</strong>: a way to ensure the place we spend most of our time—our homes—doesn't quietly make us worse off.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm documenting as much of this as I can through my writing and seeing as much of the world as possible. To me, a good life is measured by <strong>experience</strong>. Discomfort is a great signal—it means you're in uncharted territory. I try to manufacture as much of that as possible.
