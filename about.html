        <h1>About me ✍️</h1>

        <p>
          I grew up in a family where good inputs meant good outputs. We weren't big on screens—most of our time was spent outside because that's what made us feel best.
        </p>

        <p>
          That foundation led me to sports and training, then college athletics, then marathons. Somewhere along the way, I developed a reverence for what's possible when you simply <span class="highlight">feel good</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's why I'm building <strong>Nestwell</strong>: a way to ensure the place we spend most of our time—our homes—doesn't quietly make us worse off.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm documenting as much of this as I can through my writing and seeing as much of the world as possible. To me, a good life is measured by <span class="highlight">experience</span>. Discomfort is a great signal—it means you're in uncharted territory. I try to manufacture as much of that as possible.
